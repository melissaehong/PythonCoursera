07:03:02	 From Cheree Warrick : Now I can hear you with my earplugs on.  That is weird. LOL
07:03:25	 From Cheree Warrick : Yes.  
07:03:45	 From Cheree Warrick : Good morning everyone
07:04:32	 From Eric Spence : Good morning everyone
07:08:12	 From Cheree Warrick :  you are saving lives with explaining the the DEF with IF and ELSE.  lol
07:08:28	 From Cheree Warrick : Especially when you begin to explain that HOURLY RATE equation!
07:10:02	 From Melissa Hong : Hi Cheree, I can hear your audio
07:10:44	 From Cheree Warrick : Thanks Melissa...LOL
07:16:44	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : helpful-thnx
07:17:00	 From Cheree Warrick : Thanks Melissa.  
07:21:18	 From Jamie Jones  to  All Panelists : is this being recorded
07:21:21	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : they are saying the space is tiny
07:21:38	 From Jamie Jones  to  All Panelists : great thanks
07:25:32	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : why would you use that versus just putting in the number?
07:28:04	 From Cheree Warrick : That's how I figured that out... that it was based on numeric value, but I was using it by the number 
07:28:22	 From Cheree Warrick : w was in the alphabet as number 24.. lol
07:28:48	 From Cheree Warrick : That was my 'laymans
07:28:49	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : yes cheer-that is what I thought also
07:28:51	 From Cheree Warrick :  thinking
07:29:07	 From Jamie Jones  to  All Panelists : how do you get to that table
07:40:17	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : so when it’s a parameter that is essentially calling the function?
07:40:46	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : or invoking the function
07:43:08	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : so func(10) is a argument that is automatically invocked
07:43:45	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : after it is defined it auto invokes?
07:44:07	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : how are you  calling it?
07:45:08	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : would you show how in the quiz you are calling/invoking
07:47:08	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : got it
07:47:54	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : is the func(10) a parameter or an argument or neither
07:48:30	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : perfect!
07:49:23	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : perfect!   this helps a lot more and i  will keep listening
07:51:26	 From Cheree Warrick : You are helping us big time!
07:51:28	 From Cheree Warrick : Thanks
07:53:04	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : OMg-spelling it out like this is SUPER HELPFUL
07:55:34	 From Eric Spence : Agreed
07:55:37	 From Cheree Warrick : Totally Agreeing with you Sydney!
07:55:46	 From Jamie Jones  to  All Panelists : nice to know you can use. a type and input at the same time
07:56:22	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : Like this is night and day for me.  OMg!
07:56:34	 From Cheree Warrick : LOL. Sydney
07:56:55	 From Cheree Warrick : Maybe Melissa should be the one teaching Python in Coursera. 
07:57:13	 From Eric Spence : She gets my vote.
07:57:25	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : YAAAAAAAAAS!   This is much better than coursera!
07:58:06	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : won't that be equal to 40 or less (rate times hour)
07:58:37	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : what happens if the hours are 40
08:09:40	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : could you have coded <=40?
08:12:52	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : i am not sure i followed how you called the computepay function
08:13:07	 From Cheree Warrick : Good job of explaining, Melissa
08:13:54	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : i am confused because before you put in function(10) for example
08:19:14	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : the function does not run
08:20:04	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : that explains it.
08:20:55	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : Great session again, Melissa.  Thank you!  I have to jump off.
