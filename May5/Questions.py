///question 1

Here's the question I have. We're learning about defining functions. WE're asked to write a program to prompt the user for hours and rate per hour using input to compute gross pay. Award time-and-a-half for the hourly rate for all hours worked above 40 hours. Put the logic to do the computation of time-and-a-half in a function called computepay() and use the function to do the computation. The function should return a value. Use 45 hours and a rate of 10.50 per hour to test the program (the pay should be 498.75). You should use input to read a string and float() to convert the string to a number. Do not worry about error checking the user input unless you want to - you can assume the user types numbers properly. Do not name your variable sum or use the sum() function.


///question 2

What is the purpose of functions and when/why do you use them?

Can you please explain the max function?  Not clear of the use and do not understand whey it says w is the largest letter.  Why is a space the smallest thing?   This is what is part of the course.

Do not understand the Max function and  arguments. Can you explain




///question 3

Sorry one other question.    As i look at the attached question 6 from our quiz, my answer would be that it would not print anything as there is no line of code that invokes or calls the function “func”  But apparently the answer is 10 and 20.   Wouldn’t you have to have a line of code that says “print func (x)” to call/invoke?   The other question is why is the “x” in () on line 1.  In the lecture, when you define a function, the () were always left empty.

Thank you!
