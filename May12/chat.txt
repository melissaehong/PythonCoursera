07:12:34	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : does everyone the ls to get to their folders
07:13:04	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : sorry-does everyone have to type “ls” to get to their folders
07:15:39	 From Melissa Hong : platformio-ide-terminal
07:17:44	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : ok-thnx-will have to try.  want to try it with the assignments
07:20:14	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : LOL-was driving me crazy too-thanx!
07:21:11	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : showing how you are running this program in your  terminal is the detail I need
07:26:39	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : you get the same output but not sure why we need retrun
07:32:34	 From Erin  to  All Panelists : Put it after Def I_Am_Hungry and before If hotdog = true
07:33:26	 From Erin  to  All Panelists : That's not what i meant. Put hotdog = 'false' after Def I_Am-Hungry.  Leave the Def isHotDog up where you originally had it
07:34:10	 From Erin  to  All Panelists : Or, yep, put it all in a function. That should work
07:35:56	 From Erin  to  All Panelists : Put def ishotdog up above i_am_hungry
07:36:18	 From Erin  to  All Panelists : Sorry to be bothering you while you're live!  :-)
08:02:13	 From Tawana Rivers  to  All Panelists : please figure it out now
08:02:33	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : yes-not sure why done is not working and would like to figure it out
08:04:22	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : in the example you just did, isn't 100 maximum not 99
08:09:05	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : This is what i have and it works except  done
08:09:07	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : largest = None
smallest = None
while True:
    try:
        num = raw_input("Enter a number: ")
        if num == "done":
            break
        print (num)
        num = int(num)
        if largest is None or largest < num:
            largest = num
        elif smallest is None or smallest > num:
             smallest = num
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input")
 
print ("Maximum is", largest)
print ("Minimum is", smallest)
08:19:53	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : thank you!
08:26:42	 From Tawana Rivers  to  All Panelists : yes
08:26:44	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : yes-this illustration is very helpful
08:35:29	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : so it just stays at true-wasn’t totally clear on that it won’t go back to false
08:38:15	 From Tawana Rivers  to  All Panelists : I love the “T” diagram. it really helps you understand the logic.
08:43:41	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : so then the value in brackets could be anything then
08:44:22	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : so what was the purpose of  the numbers in brackets if it was really just about the place/index
08:44:47	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : you confused me when you said that tot is 0, then 1, 2, 3, 4.  (i guess its the place index)
08:45:10	 From sydney stinson : I don’t think he celery explained this in the lecture
08:45:25	 From sydney stinson : *clearly
08:46:53	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : but how does that relate to the string 5,4,3,2,1?
08:47:06	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : that's confusing
08:47:20	 From Anita Callaway  to  All Panelists : he didn't mention index values
09:01:25	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : got it-thank you
09:04:18	 From sydney stinson  to  All Panelists : very helpful-thank you
